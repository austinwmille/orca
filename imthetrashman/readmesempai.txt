"Ahhh! It's my character. I'm the trash man. I come out, I throw trash all over the ring and then I start eating garbage, and then I pick up the trash can and I bash the guy on the head." -- Frank Reynolds (Danny Devito)

This folder stores trash and derivative files.
It exists because some may yet prove useful for additional workflows (i.e. a video's transcription further used to add subtitles).

For now it is almost completely unused and doesn't even house the temporary files because, as stated, I am garbage.
