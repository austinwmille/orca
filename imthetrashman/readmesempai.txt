"Ahhh! It's my character. I'm the trash man. I come out, I throw trash all over the ring and then I start eating garbage, and then I pick up the trash can and I bash the guy on the head." -- Frank Reynolds (Danny Devito)

This folder stores trash and temporary files.
It exists because some derivative files may prove useful for additional workflows (i.e. a video's transcription further used to add subtitles).
